                                    Welcome to the library, the first stop on your way to writing a successful speech! This walkthrough will take you through all the things that you’ll need to know to engage your audience and get your ideas across by being able to present the facts.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Why focus on research? You want people to believe that you know what you're talking about! For instance, let's say your big issue is air pollution. You promise to pass a law that says all new cars must run on electricity, not gas. That should do it! But it would help if you had a few facts: How much bad air does one car create each year? How many new cars are sold in the U.S. every year? So how much will pollution be cut every year? Your speech will sound really strong if you have the facts to back it up.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Many students begin their research before they’ve even got a solid idea of a topic that they might want to use for their projects. Choosing a topic that is meaningful to you is important not only to hold your interest but will also encourage you to stay committed to the project.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The first step in the research process is to get a rough topic idea in your head before moving on. Take the “Are We A Match!” quiz to the right and then look below to see if you are ready to begin the research process.
                                </p>
                                <hr>
                                <p>
                                    (1-2 points) Your topic may or may not be of interest to you. You will want to think it through a bit more. Can you see yourself researching this topic? Perhaps make a list of other potential topics before choosing one and then retake the quiz.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    (3-4 points) Your topic probably holds some interest to you but you may want to investigate it a bit further. Perhaps do a Google search. See what kind of information is out there and if you’re still interested in the topic, move forward!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    (5+ points) Your topic is probably something that excites you and you’ve already got some ideas or background that will help propel you forward in the research process.
                                </p>

                                    Keyword searching is a type of searching you are probably already familiar with because you probably search Google using keywords. For example: "weather Detroit." They are generally the important nouns/verbs from a bigger thought or question. Out of habit you probably think of words or phrases that have to do with what you are looking for and then into the search box they go. Sometimes you may use sentences, for example: "what is the weather in Detroit?"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When searching the Library Catalog or one of the article databases, you will want to use ONLY keywords or phrases. Phrases should go in quotes, for example: “Digital Divide.” It is equally important to think of other ways of describing your topic, synonyms or antonyms. Why? Because the databases are looking for the words you use to search in different places. The author of your article may not have used the phrase “Digital Divide” with college students but instead used it with high school students. Here are my keywords and some synonyms I found while reading background information.

                                    Notice how in each case I found narrow keywords/phrases like “digital communication inequality” but also broad keywords/phrases like “students”. Notice that “affect” is NOT a keyword. Words like “affect,” “how,” “increase” don’t really add anything to our search so it is more effective to leave them out. I’ve included a worksheet you can print and use for your topic and a sample of one I’ve already filled out.

                                Before you start looking at articles in databases it is also important to understand the difference between “scholarly” and “popular” articles. It is likely that your instructor has asked you to find a mix of sources, like magazines, newspapers or scholarly journal articles. Scholarly journal articles can also be referred to as “peer-reviewed” or “refereed” articles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Peer-review and refereed articles are the same thing: the article has been submitted to researchers in the field (generally PhDs) who have told the journal that the research has been done in a quality manner and the article should be printed.

                                        “The calendar says August, but Americans are in for a snow job from President Obama’s principal organizing arm, which this month will be primarily pitching ObamaCare, along with climate change and maybe even gun control. Organizers call it grassroots “blizzarding.” Try government propaganda. Paul Bedard of The Examiner of Washington reports that Mr. Obama’s Organizing for Action group is planning high-tech assaults on GOP lawmakers along with so-called “public information" campaigns that will capitalize on social media. So, how deep will the "blizzarding" get? Think of Susan Rice, former U.N. ambassador/lackey, blaming the attack at the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, on an anti-Muslim video. Or how the Obama administration boasted ad nauseam last year that it had al-Qaida on the run yet clamped down on any references to "terrorism." Oh, what a difference a year makes, eh? Team Obama won that disinformation campaign and another four years to implement ObamaCare, capture the climate's carbon (regardless of how flat global temperatures remain) and erode freedoms that haven't already been chiseled away from constitutional protections. But this year, amid scandals that the administration denies, Americans are more skeptical -- if not angry. And no matter how it's served up, a spoonful of sap won't make ObamaCare go down any easier for a nation that doesn't want it.”

                                        “Evidence of athlete use of AS has been available since the 1950s with AS contributing to c. 60% of adverse findings according to recent WADA reports.6 In the general population there are data showing an increase in the prevalence of AS use.7 Despite such widespread use there is still some controversy as to the CV health consequences of taking AS.8 Large sample epidemiological evidence of the CV health consequences of long-term AS use is lacking, likely because of the reluctance to admit use and/or possession. In addition, evidence for a link between AS use and CV disease outcomes or end-points is mostly limited to case study reports. Published case studies include AS use associated with myocardial infarction,9 stroke,10 embolism11 and other CV health issues (table 2). Although caution should be expressed in implying cause and effect from case studies,8 they can provide direction for case series and experimental studies as well as informing/educating clinical practitioners.”

                                        “Jeff Novitzky, the investigator with the Food and Drug Administration who built the doping cases against Barry Bonds and Marion Jones, heard a variation on that line—Do we really want to know?—after he launched a federal probe into Armstrong and the U.S. Postal Service team in 2010. The U.S. attorney's office in Southern California chose not to pursue a criminal case against the Texan last February, leaving USADA and its executive director, Travis Tygart, to begin its doping investigation. Tygart invited witnesses to reiterate under oath what they had already told the Feds. After years of keeping secrets, and of what the USADA report calls significant pressure and attacks from the Armstrong camp, the truth-telling came as catharsis. According to a source familiar with the government probe, the investigators' challenge had been less to get Postal riders to talk than to get them to stop crying so they could talk.”

                                    Now that you have a good idea of the different types of articles that you’ll encounter while searching the internet or one of Wayne State University Libraries databases, you can start searching for information to back up your speech in an article database (just a big collection of articles that you can search in). We recommend Omnifile Full Text Select as a good place to search for material for this assignment but any of the General/Multidisciplinary article databases will do. Why? Because they provide broad access to many types of articles in a wide range of subject areas. Remember, you can always use the pull down menu on the article databases tab or one of the Research Guides to find subject specific databases if you’d like.

                                    Plagiarism is probably a word you’ve heard since you first began writing papers. You probably know you’re not supposed to cut/paste other’s work without “citing” it but did you also know there are many different forms of plagiarism? Take a look at the images to the left and use their definitions to decide if the scenarios below describe a form of plagiarism.

                                    You’ve probably been asked by your instructor to provide a list of citations in some sort of style in order to avoid plagiarism. This style may be MLA, APA or even Chicago. Ultimately, no matter what style that you use, you need to be able to create citations that will allow others to find the information that you used in your speech. Citations, no matter the style, contain valuable information like the name of the publication (book, article and internet pages), page numbers, the author and more. You can use the game to your right to get more acquainted with the different parts of a citation which will not only help you to identify the parts of a citation but also recognize how citations look different depending on the publication. The handout below demonstrates how to find citations for articles already created for you in the database.

                                    If you need more help with citing sources you can visit the Writing Center Collaboration and meet with a tutor. You can also get help making a fantastic PowerPoint from the technology assistants who work there.
